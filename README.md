# IOT-Controlled-boat-using-blynk
This project involves building a wireless-controlled boat using the ESP32 development board, which allows remote control via either Blynk (a mobile IoT platform). The boat is powered by DC motors with propellers for propulsion, controlled through a motor driver, and is powered by a rechargeable battery.
