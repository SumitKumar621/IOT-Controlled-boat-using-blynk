## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and developing a boat that can be **remotely controlled via a mobile phone** using the **Blynk IoT platform**. Commands such as **forward, backward, left, and right** are sent from the Blynk app, processed by the ESP32, and executed using a motor driver to control the boat’s motion.
